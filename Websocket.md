# Websocket

WebSockets provide a means for two computers to communicate via messages with each other over the world wide web. The WebSocket protocol generally works well because it operates on the same network port as web traffic, so it is generally not blocked by firewalls.

Generally, web scoket setup starts from client to server

Once a WebSocket connection is set up, four different events can take place:

1  **open** - the connection is set up and working properly

2  **message** - a message has been received from the machine on the other end of the connection

3 **error** - there is a problem with the connection

4 **close** - the connection has been terminated

Websocket provides two way communication
